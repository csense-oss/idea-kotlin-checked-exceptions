# missing todos


- @Throws on overriden methods that does not declare throws in base interface / class



- tell if certain exceptions are NOT thrown but declared.
- detect when there are overlaps in catch clauses (e.g. throwable followed by more specific type...)
- handle "*arrayOf(exception::class, exception2::class)" ....
- come up with something for init that can throw...
- SAM function(s) might not be working
- improve documentation parsing / handling
- improve the "source" target when finding e.g.
- settings for the colors etc. of the hints.
